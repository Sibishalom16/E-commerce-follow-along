# E-commerce-follow-alone


Milestone 1 

This project is a mentor-led session to build a full-fledged e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It aims to provide hands-on experience in building real-world web applications with scalable and secure features.

The **MERN stack** is a popular technology stack used for building full-stack web applications. It is favored for its **JavaScript-only approach**, which allows developers to use a single programming language (JavaScript) across the entire application, both on the frontend and backend. This approach simplifies development and is particularly beginner-friendly

The MERN stack includes:
- **MongoDB** 
- **Express.js**
- **React.js**
- **Node.js**

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that enables communication between a client and a server using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 

1. **User Authentication**
   - Register new users.
   - Log in existing users securely.
   
2. **Product Management**
   - Add new products.
   - Update product details.
   - Retrieve product data.

3. **Order Handling**
   - Manage customer orders.
   - Provide structured data responses (typically in JSON format).


## Basics of Database Schema Design

In **MongoDB**, schema design is the process of defining the structure and relationships of data stored in the database. This involves:
- Identifying key entities (e.g., Users, Products, Orders).
- Defining fields and their data types.
- Establishing relationships between collections (e.g., linking orders to users).

Good schema design ensures the database is:
- Efficient in handling queries.
- Scalable as the application grows.


## Role of Authentication in Web Applications

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user before granting access to specific resources or functionalities. In our e-commerce application:
- Users will authenticate themselves through secure login mechanisms.
- Only authenticated users can make purchases or access sensitive information like order history.

Key goals of authentication:
- Protect user data.
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Enable a personalized user experience.

# Milestone 11: Dynamic Product Display on Home Page

## Overview

This milestone focuses on making the home page display products dynamically by fetching data from the MongoDB database.  We will create a backend endpoint to retrieve product data and then use that data on the frontend to populate product cards.

## Implementation Details

*   The backend endpoint should use the appropriate MongoDB driver methods to retrieve all product documents.
*   The frontend `fetchProducts` function should use `fetch` or a similar library to make the API call.
*   The product card component should be designed to receive product data as props and display it accordingly.

# Milestone 12: My Products Page

## Overview

This milestone focuses on creating the "My Products" page, which displays all the products added by a specific user (identified by their email).  We will implement a backend endpoint to retrieve these products from MongoDB, filter them by email, and send them to the frontend.  The frontend will then dynamically display these products using the existing product card component.

## Learning Goals

*   Write an endpoint that filters data in MongoDB based on a user's email and sends the results to the frontend.
*   Receive data on the frontend.
*   Dynamically display the received data using the product card component.





# Milestone 13: Product Editing Functionality


## Overview

This project is a step-by-step implementation of an e-commerce platform.  Each milestone focuses on adding specific features and building upon the previous ones.

The project utilizes a MongoDB database to store product information and a frontend interface to interact with the data through API endpoints.

*   Implemented the ability to edit existing product data.
*   Added an "Edit" button to product cards on the frontend.
*   Developed a backend endpoint to handle updating product details in the MongoDB database.
*   Implemented form auto-filling with existing product data for editing.
*   Users can now modify product information and save the changes.  This involved:
    *   Creating an API endpoint to receive updated product data.
    *   Implementing the update operation in MongoDB.
    *   Adding an edit button to the product card.
    *   Populating the edit form with existing product data.
    *   Enabling users to edit and save the updated data.

 # Milestone 14: Deleting Product Data from MongoDB

In this milestone, we focused on implementing delete functionality for product data, allowing users to remove existing product records from the database. Key achievements include:

Backend: Creating a Delete Endpoint Developed a DELETE endpoint to remove product data from MongoDB using the product ID. Used Mongoose to find and delete the product by its ID. Implemented error handling to manage scenarios where the product ID does not exist.

Frontend: Delete Button and Request Handling Added a Delete button to each product card. Clicking the Delete button sends a request to the delete endpoint with the product ID. Implemented a confirmation dialog to ensure users intend to delete the product. Updated the product list dynamically to remove the deleted product without refreshing the page.

UI and UX Enhancements Provided feedback on successful or failed delete operations. Enhanced the user experience with a clean and responsive UI for managing product deletions.
